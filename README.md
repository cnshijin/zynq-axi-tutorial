# zynq-axi-tutorial

This is a tutorial on the usage of AMBA AXI interfaces with HW accelerators derived through High-Level Synthesis (HLS) in the IP form. Specifically, the AXI4-Lite and AXI4-Stream interfaces are examined. Our target device is Zynq-7000 APSoC and particularly, the Zedboard.

# Generating HW Accelerators through HLS

The flow of this tutorial begins with the generation of custom IPs through Vivado HLS 2014.4. We employ a very simple example as our source code.
